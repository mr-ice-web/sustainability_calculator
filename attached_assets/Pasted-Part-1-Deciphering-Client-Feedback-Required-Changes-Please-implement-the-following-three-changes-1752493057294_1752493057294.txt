Part 1: Deciphering Client Feedback & Required Changes

Please implement the following three changes based on the client's feedback:

1. Separate Calculation Steps:
* Logic: The calculator should no longer provide a single, combined total for "Campaign Distribution" and "Asset Creation." Instead, treat them as two independent modules.
* Implementation:
* Add a "Calculate Distribution Emissions" button within the Campaign Distribution section. When clicked, this button should calculate and display the emissions for only the ad distribution portion.
* The existing main "Calculate Emissions" button should be repurposed to calculate only the Asset Creation emissions (AI images, text, storage, etc.). Rename this button to "Calculate Asset Emissions."

2. Differentiate the Emissions Indicator:
* Problem: The red/yellow/green "High/Moderate/Low Emissions" indicator in the results panel looks too similar to a button.
* Implementation: Redesign the emissions indicator to be a non-interactive tag or label. It should clearly display the emissions category (e.g., "High Emissions") but should not visually resemble a clickable Call-to-Action (CTA) button. Use a different shape, font weight, or remove shadows to distinguish it.

3. Independent Calculation Modules:
* Summary: The core change is to separate the tool into two distinct calculators: one for ad distribution and one for asset creation. The user should be able to calculate one without needing to fill out the other. The results for each should be displayed in separate, clearly marked sections.

Part 2: New Feature Request - Multi-Channel Campaign Analysis

Please add a new feature to the Campaign Distribution module to allow users to calculate emissions for a multi-channel campaign.

    UI/UX Update:

        Replace the single platform dropdown with a multi-select interface (e.g., checkboxes or a multi-select dropdown with an "Add Platform" button that dynamically creates new input fields).

        Allow the user to input the Number of Impressions and Campaign Budget ($) for each selected platform individually.

    Calculation Logic:

        When the "Calculate Distribution Emissions" button is pressed, the tool should calculate the emissions for each selected platform individually.

        It should also calculate the cumulative (total) emissions for all selected platforms combined.

    Results Display:

        The results panel for distribution should be updated to show a clear breakdown.

        Display the Total Campaign Emissions prominently at the top.

        Below the total, provide a Platform-wise Breakdown, listing each selected platform and its corresponding emissions in kg COâ‚‚e.

        Continue to display the overall "Emissions per Dollar" and "Emissions per Impression," calculated using the cumulative totals.

Part 3: UI Bug Fix

    Feature Change: The information icons (labeled 'i') are intended to provide helpful context about the inputs.

    Required Action: Ensure that when a user hovers their mouse over an information icon, a tooltip or pop-up appears displaying the relevant explanatory text. This feature is not currently working and needs to be implemented correctly.
